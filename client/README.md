- The React app is a simple interface for generating SQL queries based on natural language descriptions.
- The App component is the main component containing a form with an input field for the query description and a button to trigger the query generation.
- The form submits data to the server using the generateQuery function, which makes a POST request to http://localhost:3000/generate.
- The generated SQL query is logged to the console.
